1. Encapsulation => an object hides its internal data from the codes that's outside of the class. We can encapsulate the data by giving 'private' access modifier to it.
2. We can not.
3. Read only data => The purpose is only reaching the data without making any changes. Only the instance variables are subject for this. A special public instance "getter method" is used. ex :
    public String getPassword(){return password ;}
4. Write only data => We can modify the data while protecting it. Another special method "setter" is used. This time, parameter is required.ex:
    public void setPassword(String Password){ this.password=password;  }
